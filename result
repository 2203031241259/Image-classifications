For custom datasets, results may vary depending on data quality, number of classes, and balance.

If youâ€™ve already trained the model and have logs or evaluation results, I can help you format them too.
Would you like me to generate a ready-to-upload README.md file now with everything included?

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: image classification project using Transformers"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
4. Verify on GitHub
